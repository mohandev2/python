OpenHPI Python Extension (PyOpenHPI)
====================================

Description
-----------

An extension module that makes it possible to access
HPI api functions and structures from the Python language.

It supports everything that is exposed through SaHpi.h,
SaHpiAtca.h, SaHpiBladeCenter.h, oHpi.h, and oh_utils.h.

Requirements
------------

Python >= 2.3
SWIG >= 1.3.27
GLIB >= 2.2.0
OpenHPI >= 2.10.0

Note: If any of these requirements are installed on non-standard
directories (e.g. not in /usr or /usr/local) the extension will not build.
In that case you will need to edit setup.py and deps.py to look for the
dependencies in the right directories.

Building and Installing
-----------------------

To build:

	make

	- Or -

	python setup.py build

To install:

	make install # as root

	- Or -

	python setup.py install # as root

Using
-----
To use, import the openhpi python extension like this:

	from openhpi import *

Then, you will be able to call the HPI API functions as you would in C.
All the APIs and HPI structs are managed as in C, except for
two exceptions:

	1. HPI structs are translated to objects in Python. Here
	   are some examples on how to create HPI objects:

	   	buffer = SaHpiTextBufferT()
		print buffer.Data[3] # members are accessed like in C
		print buffer.Data # This fetches the entire Data string
		buffer.Language = SAHPI_LANG_ZULU

		res = SaHpiRptEntryT()
		print res.ResourceEntity.Entry[4].EntityType
		res.ResourceEntity.Entry[4].EntityType = SAHPI_ENT_SWITCH

		dinfo = SaHpiDomainInfoT()
		print dinfo.Guid[0] # prints first character of Guid
		print dinfo.Guid # prints a string

		dentry = SaHpiDrtEntryT()
		dentry.IsPeer = SAHPI_TRUE

	   Struct members that are character arrays (like
	   SaHpiTextBufferT.Data) can be accessed as a whole string
	   by referencing the plain array as shown above.

	2. Any output argument of an HPI API call whose type is a
	   pointer to a number (e.g. SaHpiSessionIdT *SessionId) gets
	   treated differently for that API call. That argument will
	   be eliminated and returned along with the error code. So
	   for that API, a list of two values is returned. It is done
	   like this because, although possible, its cumbersome to
	   provide a reference to a number for a function call in
	   Python. This helps improves readability, since all output
	   variables end up on the left side of the assignment, and all
	   the inputs end up as function arguments on the right side.
	   Output arguments of type (char *) have also been moved to the
	   left side of the equation.
	   Following, some examples of this change:

	   	error, sid = saHpiSessionOpen(SAHPI_UNSPECIFIED_DOMAIN_ID, None)
		# if error == SA_OK, sid will contain the session id.
		event = SaHpiEventT()
		error, qstatus = saHpiEventGet(sid,
					       SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE,
					       event, None, None)
		# if error == SA_OK, qstatus contains the event queue status
		# Also, event will have the returned event

		# Printing the names of all plugins loaded
		error = SA_OK; hid = 0;
		while error == SA_OK:
			error, hid = oHpiHandlerGetNext(hid)
			hinfo = oHpiHandlerInfoT()
			error = oHpiHandlerInfo(hid, hinfo)
			if error == SA_OK:
				print hinfo.plugin_name

		# Creating a handler (instance to a plugin)
		config = { 'plugin': 'libsimulator',
			   'entity_root': '{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}',
			   'name': 'test0' }
		# First argument is a dictionary which the extension
		# converts to the proper GHashTable type.
		error, hid = oHpiHandlerCreate(config)
		# returns id of new handler

All of the files ending in .i for this package can be used as a reference in order to learn how some api calls (among other things) have been mapped to Python.
However, in order to understand those .i files another reference needs to be used:
